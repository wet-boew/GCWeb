<p>Reusable features that are into a preliminary state of experimentation. Features are built from custom CSS and/or Javascript code. Once a feature is developed and minimum requirements are met, a méli-mélo can be deployed and ready for use within one week on Canada.ca. Check out <a href="#mli-mlo-list">existing mélis-mélos</a>.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
	<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Support for méli-mélo is provided during weekly <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/wiki/WET-Office-hours,-Heures-de-service-de-la-BOEW">WET Office hours</a> hold remotely every Tuesday afternoon.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="mli-mlo-comp">Compilations</h2>

<p><strong>Every compilation's life expectancy is estimated to be approximately one (1) year</strong>, after which point it becomes "frozen" (deprecated). This should provide a feature's sponsor enough time to find resources to make their feature progressing towards an official GCWeb feature. Using a <a href="compilation-gelé/index.html" hreflang="fr">frozen méli-mélo compilation</a> into any web page is not strongly discouraged. It must be replaced by the corresponding GCWeb feature, another méli-mélo compilation or simply removed.</p>

<p>Features are grouped into compilations in order to quickly:</p>
<ul>
	<li>initiate usability research;</li>
	<li>initiate preliminary discussion with key organisation; and</li>
	<li>transforming the feature into a high quality reusable product adapted for GCWeb;</li>
	<li>regroup and ease a central coordination for new innovations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get started</h3>

<p>Below are instructions on how to create a new méli-mélo feature in GCWeb.</p>

<div class="panel panel-info">
    <div class="panel-heading">
		<h4 class="panel-title">Tip to quickly get started!</h4>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>Start by coding and/or exposing your feature and its demo(s) by leveraging <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/gcweb-jekyll">GCWeb Jekyll theme</a> before your contribution to GCWeb.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<ol class="lst-spcd-2">
	<li>Ensure your feature code is all included in one (1) JavaScript file and/or on (1) CSS file.</li>
	<li>Create a new feature folder inside the <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/GCWeb/tree/master/m%C3%A9li-m%C3%A9lo"><code>/méli-mélo</code></a> GCWeb root folder.</li>
	<li id="feature-name">Name your feature and its folder by following this notation: <code>YYYY-MM-[FeatureName]</code>. The year and month must correspond to the feature's initial publication date. For example "2021-05-steps".</li>
	<li>Create and publish your demo / working example for each individual sub-features and styles, meaning each JS configurations and CSS classes respectively, either using the <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/gcweb-jekyll">GCWeb Jekyll theme</a> or GCWeb itself.</li>
	<li>Designate a <a href="#sponsor" rel="help">sponsor<sup aria-hidden="true"><span class="fas fa-info-circle"></span></sup></a> for the feature.</li>
	<li>Build and publish an <a href="#implementation-plan" rel="help">implementation plan<sup aria-hidden="true"><span class="fas fa-info-circle"></span></sup></a>.</li>
	<li>Ensure all <a href="#requirements">minimum requirements listed above</a> are met.</li>
	<li><strong>Optional:</strong> Test your code by following the instructions on <a href="../docs/developing-en.html">developing for GCWeb</a>.</li>
	<li>Submit your new feature through a GitHub Pull request (PR) in the GCWeb repository; please consult <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/GCWeb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guidelines</a>.</li>
	<li>If changes are requested on your PR after technical review (as per <a href="#tech-checklist">checklist below</a>), collaborate with the WET-BOEW team to get it approved. For reference, first-time contribution usually requires 3+ rounds of back-and-forth code review taking a week each time.</li>
	<li>Once your PR is approved, your feature will be assigned to a <a href="#mli-mlo-comp">méli-mélo compilation</a> and released on Canada.ca at the next release window one (1) week after code is merged.</li>
	<li><strong>Strongly recommended:</strong> After release, update the méli-mélo feature code by executing the implementation plan and addressing all TODO's identified by the WET-BOEW team.</li>
	<li><strong>Recommended:</strong> Whenever possible, participate at the weekly <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/wiki/WET-Office-hours,-Heures-de-service-de-la-BOEW">WET Office hours</a> on Tuesday afternoon. The WET-BOEW team will be able to help you progress in your contribution and execute your implementation plan by finding ways to remove any technical or procedural barriers you may encounter.</li>
</ol>

<p class="mrgn-tp-lg">See <a href="2021-05-steps/index.html">2021-05-steps</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/GCWeb/tree/master/m%C3%A9li-m%C3%A9lo/2021-05-steps">folder on GitHub</a> as a complete example of a méli-mélo feature containing all the required information.</p>

	<summary>Technical review checklist</summary>

	<p>This list contains the steps that the WET-BOEW team uses to approve new méli-mélo features.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure the <a href="#sponsor">project sponsor</a> is clearly identified;</li>
		<li>Project folder name follows the proper naming convention: <code>YYYY-MM-[FeatureName]</code>;</li>
		<li>Ensure each JavaScript feature and each CSS style comes with a demo / working example;</li>
		<li>Perform a code review to ensure there are no overrides nor conflict with GCWeb and/or WET-BOEW;</li>
		<li>Perform a quick check for any major or obvious web accessibility and security issue;</li>
		<li>Ensure the feature doesn't impact any content by default on page load by leveraging closure technique unless the feature is explicitly activated through the HTML, either through the use of a CSS class or data attribute;</li>
		<li>Review the <a href="#implementation-plan">implementation plan</a> to ensure it contains reasonable due dates and deliverables.</li>
	</ul>
</details>

<h4 id="sponsor">Sponsor</h4>

<p>A sponsor is an entity responsible for ensuring a méli-mélo feature progresses towards a stable &amp; widely reusable feature as per the implementation plan. The sponsor will most likely be the author of a feature, representing their department.</p>

<h4 id="implementation-plan">Implementation plan</h4>

<p>The implementation plan, also known as a planning horizon, is meant to set milestones in order to get a méli-mélo feature stabilized into the WET-BOEW / GCWeb code base. It must contain the following milestones:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Engagement with the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) at Treasury Board Secretariat;</li>
	<li>Review and perform the identification of the feature transformation requirement to be able to complete the integration progress into GCWeb;</li>
	<li>Produce accessibility conformance report and attach usability report (if any);</li>
	<li>Transformation of the méli-mélo functionality into a GCWeb provisional feature;</li>
	<li>Complete feature stabilisation task, including amongst other things working example translation, writing guidance, publishing <abbr title="Accessibility Conformance Reports">ACR</abbr>s, feature API documentation, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each item of the plan must have an <strong>estimated due date</strong> as an indicator to measure integration progress into GCWeb. The expectation is to get the méli-mélo feature fully integrated into GCWeb within its lifespan of approximatively one (1) year. See an <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wet-boew/GCWeb/master/m%C3%A9li-m%C3%A9lo/2021-05-steps/meta.md">example of an implementation plan</a>.</p>

<h4>Versioning</h4>

<p>This framework for méli-mélo compilations and features are excluded from the <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-documentation/decision/3.html">GCWeb public API</a>. Any change or removal would only trigger a patch release of GCWeb. This means developers are fully responsible (but not required) to document any subsequent change they make to their méli-mélo feature.</p>
