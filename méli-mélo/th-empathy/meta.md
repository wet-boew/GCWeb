  These colours meet the colour contrast requirements as outlined in WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum). After validation using webaim online contrast checker, I can certified that the color matches used in this thematic are meeting a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text and also a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components. I did my due diligence and to knowledge and from my understanding, all elements of this thematic are meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standrds.
