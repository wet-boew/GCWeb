<p>Might be still in-scope of the new look or to be fixed later (13 issues)</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Item 41 (High)</strong> - This is high priority for other that are implementing the new look, this issue is to ensure the latest version of the menu is published on the CDN at a stable location and are made available for other implementation.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 51 (Medium) -</strong> Request to modify the Service initiation template. To be done after at the same time of making GCWeb template conforming to content and IA spec 1.5 or if the new page type structure work is completed and well defined.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 53 (Medium) -</strong> This require to modify the Act profile and Regulation profile template. To be done after at the same time of making GCWeb template conforming to content and IA spec 1.5 or if the new page type structure work is completed and well defined.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 55 (Medium) -</strong> This require to modify the Campaing page example 1 and 2 template. To be done after at the same time of making GCWeb template conforming to content and IA spec 1.5 or if the new page type structure work is completed and well defined.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 64 (Low) -</strong> Apply new font to button and submit button. To be done later when more test case is created. Forcing the style to submit button are now out of scope.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 66 (Low) -</strong> Apply new font to form and button. To be done later when more test case is created.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 73 (Medium) -</strong> The menu behaviour would be post launched updated.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 74 (Medium) -</strong> The menu behaviour would be post launched updated.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 86 (Medium) -</strong> The same issue happen with the WET-BOEW theme when the page is resized to it's minimal width. Fixing that would require further investigation and it is not related at the new look.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 91 (Low) -</strong> Documenting the multi-page navigation would be done post launch.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 94 (Medium) -</strong> This is a new requirement. It would be applied at a later date</li>
	<li><strong>Item 95 (High) -</strong> More testing should be planned and executed prior to apply globally the limited content width.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 96 (High) -</strong> This is a new requirement.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be fixed/addressed later on (9 issues)</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Item 3 (Low) -</strong> Need to re-test and be reproducible, might not be an issue anymore</li>
	<li><strong>Item 8 (Low) -</strong> Still a weird issue that are happening on that device, but it might related to the use of datatable which have a large width and the media query. More testing need to be done. Don't see that issue on desktop when reducing the browser width.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 61 (Medium) - </strong>Styling differently the first h2 in the main contain could be quite chanlanging. Need to create a few test case, see comments bellow.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 12 (Low) -</strong> This issue is specific to IE11 and the wet-boew theme have the same issue. So a fix must be made upstream instead. This might be related to the use of fix font size instead of relative font-size.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 13 (Low) -</strong> Need to re-test and be reproducible, might not be an issue anymore or this scenario are realy specific to FF when it is use in a special way.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 38 (Low) -</strong> It will be a nice feature to have, but not part of the requirement.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 43 (High/Medium) -</strong> That issue need to be fixed upstream or it's going to be fixed when the new font size would be also applied to forms.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 46 (Medium) -</strong> This is just a group of reported issue identify from item 47 to 61 inclusivly.</li>
	<li><strong>Item 62 (Low) -</strong> This would require more testing from various device and from various internet speed.</li>

	<li>Item 78. Fixed December 17 - Published an excerpt of the answer.</li>
	<li>Item 77. Fixed December 14 - Symbole of GoC SVG image, based on the ones provided, was submited to TBS for their review and approval. <a href="https://github.com/gc-proto/GCWeb/pull/1">gc-proto#1</a></li>
	<li>Item 69. Fixed December 4 - Moved down the Glyphicon of one additional pixel to perceive it aligned with accompagning text.</li>
	<li>Item 11. Comments November 11 - That item it is just a comments/opinion, TBS testing didn't reported that as an error so we can assume that was the intend.</li>
	<li>Item 68. Fixed November 30 - Blockquote font size was set to 1em.</li>
	<li>Item 65. Comment November 30 - Fixed a small issue with font-size on button, it's now reset to old size only when button are in a form, this was creating some conflic with some WET plugin.</li>
	<li>Item 65. Completed November 29 - Documentation, working example and instruction was added</li>
	<li>Item 67. Fixed November 29 - Each page have an hard coded inline copy of the top menu items (themes).</li>
	<li>Item 65. Partially fix on November 28 - The new CSS was added <code>force-style-gcweb-4-0-29</code>, it still need to be documented.</li>
	<li>Item 66. Temporyfix implemented on November 28 - The content of a form are excluded from the new font style. it still need to be documented.</li>
	<li>Item 60. Fixed on November 27</li>
	<li>Item 63. Fixed on November 26</li>
	<li>Item 60. Comment on November 26 - What this means exactly? "Set no common ligatures for all headers/Lato fonts"</li>
	<li>Item 61. Comment on November 26 - We would need to develop a few test cases because it might hard to target the first h2 because publisher use different implement in the content area. Like "h1 ~ h2:nth-of-type(1)"; "h1 ~ div:nth-of-type(1) h2:nth-of-type(1)"; "h1 ~ section:nth-of-type(1) h2:nth-of-type(1)". But those selector can be very unstable. Like "h1, h2, section>h2" OR the first h2 is an alert box??. Those special test case need to be reviewed and tested before.</li>
	<li>Item 60. Comment on November 26 - For the default limited width, as discussed, that would happend when new pages would automatically include the content limited width special class. We are not going to enforce that behaviour on any existing content. Only newly created content should contain that class, and the publisher would be able to remove it. Minimize the risk of breaking the layout of existing content. If that need to be enforced by default and the feature removed upon request, then we would need a massive list of test case to ensure the stability of that new feature.</li>
	<li>Item 5. Fixed on November 22 - The max width of the input was adjusted for extra small view port. An optimal value was set to avoid the search button being under the search input field. Idem for the extra-extra small view port.</li>

	<li>Item 36. Fixed on November 13, 2018 - The base padding on button was re-ajusted to ensure the minimal target size is 44 by 44 CSS pixel</li>
	<li>Item 37. Comment on November 13, 2018 - In order to meet "SC 1.4.12: Text spacing" and "SC 1.4.11. Non-text contrast" would require an extensive search in WET-BOEW and GCWeb. For text spacing a quick check reveal that several component overwride text spacing in various and inconsistant way. For Non-text Contrast a quick review of the understanding reveal that default bootstrap style, each component and each plugin would need to be reviewed to ensure their conformity. A considerable effort for analysing, implementing and testing are going to be required in order to meet those success criteria and to ensure consistance. Like to ensure the style of all input control are done the same way.</li>

Fixed an issue about SC 1.4.4. Ensuring the menu separator orientation are properly adjusted for the keyboard nav with the most requested menu item. Removed global initial set for the "tabindex" on each menu item.</li>
	<li>Item 35. Fixed on November 9, 2018 - New CSS class added with working example and documentation. See the migration instruction for more details.</li>
	<li>Item 28. Not reproducible November 8, 2018 - Not able to reproduce that issue, it might got indirectly fixed by another fixed issue.</li>

	<li>Item 33. Parially fixed on November 5, 2018 - The doormats heading size was put as the same as the heading level 5 (h5). Should we scope/wrap all those component with an unique CSS class in order to control more precisely their styling? That is not how it is currently done.</li>
	<li>Item 2. Fixed on November 2, 2018 - See Item 14</li>
	<li>Item 10. Fixed on November 2, 2018 - See Item 19</li>

	<li>Item 21. Fixed on November 2, 2018 - To note that in the Content and IA spec, figure 1 is outdated as per this requirement. See location of the illustrated date modified.</li>
	<li>Item 22. Fixed on November 2, 2018 - (Going to be fix later) We will apply a temporary an automated solution only for WMS, but for implementer outside WMS, this update will require a markup change for all Topic pages/Institutional/Theme pages. etc... because the dormat link size was set to the same height of an heading level 5, now if the requirement is to have it at 17px, that means they need to match the size of heading level 6 (<code>.h6</code>).</li>
	<li>
		<p>Item 23. Comment on November 2, 2018 - Before to use it, I recommend to look at it further. It is explicitly said that anti-aliasing CSS is not in a standard track and it is recommended to avoid. Currently that feature is only limited to webkit browser and FF by applying some prefix vendor. I didn't deeply research, but I can easily assume that if that feature was drop it is because maybe a similar effect can be acheived by using another methodoly. My recommendation before to set that CSS is to do a little bit more research and try to find out if there alternative solution that would be cross-browser compatible.</p>
		<p>See:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><q>Though present in early (2002) drafts of CSS3 Fonts, font-smooth has been removed from this specification and is currently not on the standard track.</q> - <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=font-smoothing">https://caniuse.com/#search=font-smoothing</a></li>
			<li><q>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user.

		</ul>
		<p>The see also article make reference that playing with the anti-aliasing feature make the font more blury for use, so less readable.</p>
		<p>Recommendation: Won't fix unless if we have a confirmation this is an essential feature.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Item 24. Comment on November 2, 2018 - Please provide the full list of the new font-size, that for each heading level, to use on small and extra small view.</p>
		<p>Currently it is set:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>h1: 38px</li>
			<li>h2: 37px</li>
			<li>h3: 28px</li>
			<li>h4: 23px</li>
			<li>h5: 20px</li>
			<li>h6: 17px</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Item 28. Comment on November 2, 2018 - Can you re-test and provide more info on this issue, I know they were an issue for the  menu width for the demo page limited width content, but that was fixed by Item 6 and 7.</li>
	<li>Item 29. Fixed on November 2, 2018</li>
	<li>Item 6. Fixed on October 31, 2018</li>
	<li>Item 7. Fixed on October 31, 2018</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reported issue list</h2>

<ul>
	<li><del><strong>Fixed - Item 1.</strong> Content: Ensure the text for each first link change properly in mobile vs deskop. That is the first menu item in the popup side panel. (Menu level 2)</del></li>
	<li><del><strong>Fixed - Item 2.</strong> UX: On desktop, when the user click on the right arrow from an sub-menu item, excluding the first link, it go inside the first item in  the "most requested" sub-sub-menu. This need to be documented and described better</del></li>
	<li><strong>Item 3.</strong> Bug: Trivial/Minor. In FF only when we are in mobile mode. When navigation with a combinaison of keyboard and mouse, then we click on an menu item with the mouse, then the new page it show, then we use the "back" button of the browser. The focus are lost in FF. This is not happening in IE11. As FF for mobile have a low market share and this bug is only related to FF and this bug was only tested in desktop by trying to emulate mobile That is the reason it is a trivial priority bug.</li>
	<li><del><strong>Fixed - Item 4.</strong> Bug: The first menu item don't open on mouse hover. To reproduce: 1. Load the page; 2. Mouse hover the menu button; 3. Move the mouse gently to the first immediate menu item; 4. it's expected the sub menu will open; 5. The sub menu don't open; 6. If you hover any subsequent top menu item (like the following one) and then go back to the first menu item, the sub-menu open as it should be.</del></li>
	<li><del><strong>Fixed - Item 5.</strong> UI: On mobile mode (small view and bellow) the search button appear bellow the search field. It might be expected to always appear beside the search input field.</del></li>
	<li><del><strong>Fixed - Item 6.</strong> Bug: On the "Content limited width" page, the forced width conflict with the menu. The width should be changed for "max-width" and the effect should be limited to the content inside the main element.</del></li>
	<li><del><strong>Fixed - Item 7.</strong> Bug: On the "Content limited width" page, the hidden top skip link are not centered, but left aligned. Idem for when that page is in "Basic HTML mode", all the warning message are left aligned. It might be related to the other bug related ot the "Content limited width"</del></li>
	<li><strong>Item 8.</strong> Bug: On the main index page of GCWEb (/themes-dist/GCWeb/index-en.html) Using Chrome for mobile with a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone: An expanded menu item can't be collapsed. The most requested sub-menu should be collapsed by default in mobile, but it is expanded. That means the JS that colapse the most-requested menu do not fired correctly. However, there is no issue when mobile is emulated through desktop.</li>
	<li><del><strong>Unreproducible Item 9.</strong> ~Style: There is some blue mouse hover that appear, idem for when the link is mark as visited. I briefly saw that issue in IE11 but it need to be investigated more.</del></li>
	<li><del><strong>Fixed - Item 10.</strong> UI ~Bug: Inconsistent spacing between section. There is almost no space when you look at the right floating image after the section "On Focus" followed by the section "Your government". Suggestion to increase the spacing.</del></li>
	<li><del><strong>Comment - Item 11.</strong> ~Style: There is a large spacing between the main menu and the h1 of a content page in large/extra large view.</del></li>
	<li><strong>Item 12.</strong> Bug: The text can't be enlarged at 200% in IE11, but it work in FF. I got the same behaviour with WET theme and with the previous GCWeb theme.</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Item 13.</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Home page : http://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/home-en.html</li>
			<li>Page d’accueil : http://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/home-fr.html</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The issue is encountered in the Firefox browser. The pages will lose the focus when I am using alternatively between the mouse and the keyboard navigation at the same time. For example: I load a page in the browser then navigate by keyboard and switch to the mouse. There is no problem but when I switch back to the keyboard the focus will be lost on the menubar (neither submenu). I will have nowhere to go unless I am refreshing the page. Good news is everything works fine in the IE.</p>

		<p><del>This issues are about the submenu in the menuitem when i navigate the menu by keyboard interaction. I am not able to switch back and forth between the “Most requested” and each “item” in the submenu by using the Right Arrow and Left Arrow. Even though, the “Most requested” and “item” in the submenu are the same level. I can only use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow to navigate from the top to the bottom and vice vesa.</del></p>
		<p><del>(Note that if the focus is either on any “item” in the submenu or on the “Most requested” then I hit Left Arrow that brings me back to the menuitem)</del></p>

	<li><del><strong>Fixed - Item 15.</strong> Home page: red line under Canada.ca is supposed to be 4px thick</del></li>
	<li><del><strong>Fixed - Item 16.</strong> Home page: Tablet view - there's a point where the Canada.ca banner is cutting too small and the header is smaller than the body copy - it should still be running more or less full width.</del></li>

	<li><del><strong>Comments - Item 24.</strong> The particularly important ones: We had headers/doormat paragraph change size for mobile to make them larger and easier to use:</del>

				<ul>
					<li>When a page has the <code>&lt;body class=”cnt-wdth-lmtd”&gt;</code> we’d like all the h2s, except the first child (the first h2 on the page), to have additional spacing at the top (all other h2s below). See example here of what that looks like: <a href="https://gc-proto.github.io/student-loans/scenarioA/services/benefits/student-aid/repay-student-loan.html">https://gc-proto.github.io/student-loans/scenarioA/services/benefits/student-aid/repay-student-loan.html</a></li>

	<li><strong>Item 62</strong> I remarked a font blinking on page force reload. I think it is cause by the delay to download and apply the google font at the current page.

	<li><del><strong>Fixed Item 63</strong> Set a max-width for heading for pages with content width limited. The value are the following:</del>

			<li><del>h6 - 65ch</del></li>
			<li><del>li - 63ch</del></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Item 64</strong> Set the submit buttons style the same as the "call to action". It will be preferable to get a confirmation if we force that style to any submit button, even if they already have a style like "btn-primary" on it.
		<p>Styling by default any submit button might had a huge impact on overall form. Additional test case is required showing all the various way a submit button can be used. The current issue is the new margin specified with the "call-to-action" button style conflict how the margin is done for other "input/select/..." forms elements</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Get a confirmation if that style must overwrite any existing style</li>
			<li>Create a series of test cases</li>
			<li>Adjust the style for a smooth migration</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here the CSS when we all the test case would be ready:</p>
		<pre><code>// File: src/buttons/_base.scss
.btn, button[type=submit].btn, input[type=submit].btn {
	font-family: Lato, sans-serif; // same font as %defaults-alternative-font-family
	font-size: 1.1em;
	margin-bottom: 25px;
	margin-top: 15px;
	padding: .5em 1em;
}

input[type=submit].btn {
	padding-bottom: 2em;
}

/* Call-to-action button style - new with GCWeb v2 */
.btn-call-to-action, button[type=submit].btn, input[type=submit].btn {
	@include button-variant( #fff, #318000, #458259 );
