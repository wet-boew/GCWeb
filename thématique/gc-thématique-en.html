			<label for="req10">Must be designed with conformance with the <a href="https://design.canada.ca/architecture/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html">Canada.ca content and information architecture specification</a> in mind. The conformance to directives, standards and specifications remains the responsibility of the publisher when implementing the thematic into a web page;</label>
		</li>
		<li class="checkbox">
			<input type="checkbox" id="req11">
			<label for="req11">Must not contain any interference with WET-BOEW, GCWeb;</label>
		</li>
		<li class="checkbox">
			<input type="checkbox" id="req12">
			<label for="req12">Must not change the state of generic pages when features are loading. The feature must be explicitly activated through HTML by the web publisher, like <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/demos/helloworld/helloworld-en.html">WET-BOEW plugins</a> or by using a CSS class to hook onto an HTML element;</label>
		</li>
		<li class="checkbox">
			<input type="checkbox" id="req13">
			<label for="req13">Must be coded by respecting the code linting practice of GCWeb in order to successfully pass the build scripts, which includes: <a href="https://htmllint.github.io/demo.html" rel="external">HTMLlint</a>, <a href="https://eslint.org/demo" rel="external">ESlint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/develop/docs/rules" rel="external">SASSlint</a> (See <a href="https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/develop/docs/rules">SASSlint configs on WET-BOEW</a>);</label>

			<input type="checkbox" id="req15">
			<label for="req15">Must be temporary or must provide a pre-approved action plan by the WET-BOEW team and related stakeholders.</label>
		</li>
		<li class="checkbox">
			<input type="checkbox" id="req16">
			<label for="req16">Favour a naming convention for sub-features that represents the campaign followed by their function. This is to avoid collision with other styles, for example: <code>.bg-canadaday</code>.</label>
		</li>
	</ul>
</fieldset>

<p>Most of the information gathering from the rules described above must be put in a <a href="#th-meta">meta file</a> accompanied with the project, see <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/GCWeb/tree/master/m%C3%A9li-m%C3%A9lo/th-canadaday">Canada day project</a> as an example.

<p>Keep in mind that all active features from any GC promotional thematic project are going to be merged into one unique CSS file and one unique JS file, like any <a href="../méli-mélo/méli-mélo-en.html#mli-mlo-list">méli-mélo compilation</a>. This framework for GC promotional thematic projects is excluded from the <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-documentation/decision/3.html">GCWeb public API</a>. Any change or removal would only trigger a patch release of GCWeb. That means the author is fully responsible but not required to document any subsequent change they would make to their project.</p>

<h3 id="progressive">Progressive enhancement approach</h3>
<p>If any thematic feature is removed from a web page, that page doesn't "break" and can still be navigated without any functional or design issues nor accessibility failures caused by such removal. If helpers are used to keep a web page's integrity, the project must have implementation notes just like the <a href="../méli-mélo/th-canadaday/détails-en.html">Canada day's implementation notes on its Details page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="expiration">Expiration date</h3>
<p>A promotional thematic feature has to indicate a removal target date that is less than one (1) year from its original submission. As needed, extensions can be granted upon agreement of interest parties. During the renewal process, the WET-BOEW maintainers team may: (1) ask for additional evidence for an extension, (2) require the removal of some sub-features or (3) initiate their conversion into experimental features or having the thematic integrated as a stable feature.</p>

<h4>Long term thematic feature</h4>
<p>During the renewal of a thematic, the WET-BOEW team will analyze whether the feature should become a long term feature or not. In the eventuality that it does become a long term feature, an action plan inspired by the experimental feature must be provided. The exact goal and outcome would be adapted on a case by case basis via a discussion and pre-agreement between all the involved stakeholders. Delays may occur and should be expected in such situations.</p>

	<h2>Temporary implementation measure</h2>
	<p>We are currently in the progress of adapting our build scripts to support GC promotional thematic features on their own. As an interim measure, we are going to use the méli-mélo compilation named "gc-thematic" to let departments start using this framework for their GC promotional campaign needs.</p>
