<p>The <code>wb-clndr</code> component in WET-BOEW provides date-related functionalities such as displaying calendars, enabling date selection, and supporting multiple date formats. The component is designed to handle date input efficiently across various browsers and use cases.</p>
<p>The component includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>.wb-clndr:</strong> Triggered to initiate an Ajax request based on the provided options. It is responsible for generating and navigating the calendar, allowing users to select dates and view different months and years.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>.wb-clndr</code> class is integral to the <code>cal-events</code> component, where it manages the display and navigation of the event calendar. When an event with this class is triggered, it handles updating the calendar interface, including switching months and years, and adjusting the displayed dates accordingly.</p>
<p>It is used in the following components:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/gcweb-compiled-demos/wetboew-demos/cal-events/cal-events-en.html">Calendar of Events</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/demos/datepicker/datepicker-en.html">Input type="date" polyfill (date picker)</a></li>
</ul>
